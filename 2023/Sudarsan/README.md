## Intro

Hi Folks star_struck,

I'm Sudarsan astronaut from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. I'm really passionate about building web applications using Django Rest Framework and ReactJS, which are some of my favorite tools in my developer toolbox. I'm also really comfortable with Java, JavaScript, and Python, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing as a developer.

I'm fairly new to the open-source world, but I'm eager to dive in and start contributing to projects that can make a positive impact. That's why I'm really excited about the opportunity to work with Wagtail in the Google Summer of Code program. I think Wagtail is an awesome content management system, and I'm excited to learn more about it and help make it even better.

Overall, I'm just a curious and motivated developer who loves to tackle new challenges and build cool stuff. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a bit better...!
